🟢 Merge Sort

What is it?
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It splits an array into smaller chunks, sorts them, and merges them back together.

Why it’s cool:

🔹 Efficient: O(n log n) time

🔹 Stable: keeps equal elements in order

🔹 Works on arrays of any size

How it works (simplified):

1.Divide the array into halves until you get single elements.

2.Recursively sort each half.

3.Merge the halves back into a sorted array.
